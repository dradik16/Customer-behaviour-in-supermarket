# Simulation of customer behaviour in supermarket with time series approach using comprehensive Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chains.
This project simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket with time series approach using comprehensive Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) simulations.
The hypothetical supermarket consist of several sections including the checkout (endpoint). The procedure includes exploration of the recorded data within a single day of a week, 
calculation of transition probabilites from one section of the supermarket to others, producing MCMC procedure for multiple customers, 
verifying key data such as average time spent with the original dataset. 
As a result of this procedure later repeated for data pertaining for other week days, MCMC approach's prediction accuracy was checked vs. the recorded results and was proven to be 
pretty accurate with a tendency of delivering somewhat larger average time spent that the one recorded by 4,5 %
